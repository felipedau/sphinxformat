The LIONESS implementation and the xcounter CTR mode class are adapted
from "Experimental implementation of the sphinx cryptographic mix packet
format by George Danezis".

Enabling ECC (curve25519) support:

- You'll need swig, as well as a populated /usr/include/python-2.6
  directory.
- cd curve25519 && make && cd ..

Testing:

- ./SphinxClient.py  or  ./SphinxClient.py -ecc

The latter is smaller and faster, but requires curve25519 support to be
enabled.
